# Lawyer Website Main Page Structure (Marketing + SEO)

This document describes the optimal main page structure for a law firm or private attorney's website. The structure is designed considering marketing, SEO, Core Web Vitals, and E-E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) factors.

## 1. Header

- **Components**:
    - Logo and a short slogan (e.g., "Moscow Law Group").
    - Main menu (up to 6 items): Services, About Us, Case Studies, Blog, Contact, 24/7.
    - A contrasting **"Free Consultation"** button that remains visible on scroll (sticky).
    - Clickable phone number and messenger icons (WhatsApp / Telegram).
- **SEO/UX**: Use the `<nav>` tag and `aria-label` for navigation. Phone numbers should be in `tel:` format and marked up with `schema.org/ContactPoint`.

## 2. Hero Block (Above the fold)

- **Height**: No more than 650px.
- **Components**:
    - **`H1` Header**: Main commercial phrase (e.g., "Family and Inheritance Lawyer Services in Moscow").
    - **Subheading**: Promise of a result and social proof ("Over 600 cases won since 2014").
    - **List (3 items)**: Key advantages (e.g., fixed price, results-oriented work, payment plans available).
    - **Main CTA**: "Assess Case Prospects →" button and/or a simple contact form (name, phone).
- **SEO**: The `H1` must be unique, up to 65 characters, and include keywords "Lawyer + City + Specialization".

## 3. Trust Block ("Why Us" / Trust Signals)

    - Icons with key metrics: years of experience, percentage of cases won, academic degrees.
    - Logos of clients, partners, or media where featured.
- **Microdata**: `LegalService` with `AggregateRating`.

## 4. "Services" Block

- **Components**:
    - 4-6 cards for key services. Each card should have an icon, a short pain-point-oriented description, and a "Learn More" button.
- **SEO**: Each card links to a separate, detailed service page (with prices, relevant case studies, FAQ). This creates a proper site silo structure.

## 5. Case Studies / Practice

- **Components**:
    - Slider with 3-5 recent successful cases. Case structure: "Problem → Strategy → Result" (with figures and links to court decisions).
    - "View All Cases" button.

    - Embedded YouTube video testimonial (with lazy-loading for speed).
    - Carousel with text testimonials (name, city, client photo).

## 7. Team

- **Components**:
    - Photos of key lawyers/partners.
    - Caption: specialization, experience, link to a personal page.

    - 3 recent articles optimized for informational queries (e.g., "how to file for divorce," "inheritance timelines").
    - "Read All Articles" button.
